# Face Detection

This project implements face detection algorithms to locate human faces in images or video streams.

## Features

- User-Friendly Interface: Drag-and-drop or browse to upload images directly from your device.
- Deep Learning Model Integration: Pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet50, or MobileNetV2 can be readily integrated for efficient image classification.
- Model Explainability (Optional): For advanced users, provide explanations or saliency maps to elucidate the reasoning behind predictions.

## Technologies

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for a responsive and interactive user interface.
- Backend: Python to handle server-side logic, model loading, and prediction requests.

## Frontend Development

- Create an HTML page with drag-and-drop or file upload functionality.
- Implement JavaScript code to handle user interactions, image upload, and communication with the backend.

## Prerequisites:

- Python (version 3.10 or later)
- Necessary libraries (refer to requirements.txt for specific dependencies)
